# PacketAnalyser
An OpenVPN/Wireguard traffic analyser with Tensorflow. Using TCPDump

# My Idea
Code a program that would allow for a server to analyse traffic on a linux VPN server using OpenVPN or Wireguard by hooking onto the tun0 or wg0 interface and detect anomalies using Tensorflow, that would potentially block threats and save the network from attacks.

# Programming Language
Initial code in Python, then a compiled language like C# or C++.

# Progress
Starting to work on it.
